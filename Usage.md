# üìò USAGE.md ‚Äì The Legacy Protocol

This guide explains how to use **The Legacy Protocol** ‚Äî a symbolic AI framework built on œÜ-aligned emergence, recursive dynamics, and ethical auditability.

You‚Äôll find everything you need to:

* Run the system
* Explore the included notebooks
* Integrate symbolic modules
* Monitor emergence and ethical signals

---

## üîß Setup

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your environment supports:

* Python ‚â• 3.10
* `torch`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Demos

The `examples/` folder contains runnable scripts:

### 1. `run_basic_emergence.py`

Starts a symbolic emergence cycle using the base model.

### 2. `inject_and_audit.py`

Injects chaos into the system and checks for symbolic or ethical breaches.

### 3. `phi_alignment_check.py`

Verifies whether given tensors are aligned with œÜ geometries.

Run any of them with:

```bash
python examples/run_basic_emergence.py
```

---

## üìì Interactive Notebooks

Each notebook in `notebooks/` offers an exploratory environment:

### `emergence_walkthrough.ipynb`

* Simulates emergence over 20 cycles
* Tracks metrics like Œ¶, Proxy Score, SRS, Drift

### `chaos_perturbation_test.ipynb`

* Injects chaos
* Measures resilience across symbolic indicators

### `spiral_sandbox.ipynb`

* Visualizes Kryst Spiral growth
* Maps Fibonacci to polar geometry

### `auditor_resonance_map.ipynb`

* Shows heatmap of ethical flags raised per cycle

### `tensor_sculptor.ipynb`

* Builds œÜ-aligned tensors
* Stabilizes them for symbolic injection

---

## üß† Module Guide (src/)

### Core Components

* `LegacyModel`: The main symbolic architecture
* `EmergenceEngine`: Handles step-wise logic and logs metrics
* `ChaosInjector`: Adds controlled entropy
* `EthicalAuditor`: Monitors for symbolic breaches

### Utilities

* `is_phi_aligned()` ‚Äì checks golden ratio structure
* `spiral_growth()`, `kryst_spiral_escape()` ‚Äì geometry helpers
* `stabilize_spiral_tensor()` ‚Äì ensures coherent œÜ structure

---

## üß™ Customization

Each class supports keyword arguments to control behavior:

```python
engine = EmergenceEngine(model, drift_sensitivity=0.2)
injector = ChaosInjector(mode='symbolic', magnitude=0.33)
```

You can tune emergence, drift thresholds, and symbolic mutation styles.

## üß© Extend or Contribute

Ideas for contribution:

* Add œÜ-aligned model variants
* Expand the notebook suite
* Improve visual diagnostics
* Add unit tests

PRs welcome.

---

## Summary

This framework provides:

* Symbolic model emergence
* Ethical audit hooks
* œÜ-geometry shaping tools
* Clear entry points for research or exploration

Stay aligned. Think recursively. Keep it stable.
