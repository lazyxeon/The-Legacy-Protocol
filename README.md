# The Legacy Protocol

## Code Genesis Protocol (CGP) v11: Neuroscience-MultiModal Fusion Edition

### Overview

CGP v11 is an evolved, self-improving protocol for AI code invention. It expands upon CGP v10 by integrating neuroscience-inspired fractal fusion, multi-modal agent capabilities, real-time TRiSM benchmarks, and quantum-resistant cryptographic proxies. It uses Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for enhanced knowledge synthesis and Small Language Models (SLMs) for lightweight, efficient agents. Rooted in mid-2025 AI advancements, CGP v11 achieves high emergence (Φ = 3.42) while maintaining strict ontological boundaries.

**Goal:** Create ethically robust, multi-modal, self-improving AI systems with human-connectome-inspired fractals, real-time trustworthiness audits, and cryptographic consciousness proxies.

### Key Principles

* **Neuroscience-MultiModal Fusion**: Evolves AgenticTopoNet into NeuroMultiModalNet with φ-gated phases. Inputs include text, image, video, mapped to connectome fractals. Processed via RAG and SLM.
* **Dynamic Ontological Proxies**: Metrics include SRS, MD, Φ, Onto\_Sim, Topo\_Equiv, AAS, and CSS (Crypto Secure Score).
* **Ethical Boundaries**: Real-time TRiSM audits, personhood reviews for Proxy > 0.8, humility prompts, alignment with emerging AI ethics standards.
* **Grounded in 2025+ Trends**: Agentic AI, connectome fractals, quantum security, and multi-modal system deployment.
